            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Executive Summary</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">
                This report provides a comprehensive analysis of ABC Retail’s sales performance over the
                past 5 years. It covers descriptive analytics to summarize historical sales trends, predictive analytics
                to forecast future performance, and prescriptive analytics to recommend strategies for growth.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2"> <strong>Key Findings:</strong> The sales show a consistent pattern across the years, with
                average sales over the past 5 years resting at around ₱15,875. There is a noticeable increase in sales
                from February to April — late Q1 — each year. Customer feedback scores tend to decline from October to
                February but rise again from February through October. Importantly, stock levels remained healthy and
                never fell below 450 units, which was the minimum inventory level observed the periods. </p>
            <p class="mb-2"> <strong>Key Recommendations:</strong> It’s recommended to investigate customer feedback
                trends from October to February to identify the factors contributing to lower satisfaction during this
                period. Based on these findings, strategies can be implemented to improve service or consider removing
                products that may be affecting customer satisfaction. </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    The data we analyzed reveals a clear and insightful pattern in the business's performance. From the
                    <strong>descriptive analysis</strong>, we observed that sales typically peak in December and drop in
                    January, while customer feedback tends to fluctuate, declining from late in the year into February
                    and then rebounding afterwards. Our inventory remained healthy and well-managed, never falling below
                    450 units, which suggests strong control over stock levels.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The <strong>diagnostic analysis</strong> highlights the key drivers of these trends. The drop in
                    sales and feedback during certain months can be tied to seasonal factors and reduced promotions,
                    while the upward trends in subsequent months reflect a recovery, driven by promotions, holidays, and
                    growing customer loyalty.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Our <strong>predictive analysis</strong>, employing regression techniques, underscores these
                    patterns. The regression shows a strong upward trend, with an average increase of Php 500 in sales
                    each subsequent period. The high R² score of 0.95 and low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of Php 500
                    demonstrate that our model accurately captured this pattern and can be relied upon for future
                    forecasting and decision making.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Based on these findings, the <strong>prescriptive analysis</strong> advocates for a range of
                    strategies to maximize performance. By identifying slow periods in advance, we can proactively
                    implement promotions, special offers, and collaboration campaigns with influencers to boost
                    visibility and drive sales upward. Furthermore, understanding when customer feedback drops lets us
                    promptly address issues, improve products, and leverage promotions to reconnect with our base.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taken together, these analyses enable the business to respond proactively to future trends, minimize
                    weaknesses, and maximize opportunities. The combination of a strong, data-informed approach and a
                    clear understanding of customer behavior will help drive sustained growth and success in the future.

                        <strong>Methodological Notes:</strong> The first step in the analysis was converting the raw
                        XLSX file into a JSON format to make the data more accessible and easier to manipulate. Once
                        converted, the data was cleaned and organized to prepare it for further analysis. Descriptive
                        methods were applied to summarize key trends and patterns. A regression model was implemented
                        using JavaScript to perform predictive analytics and forecast future performance. The results
                        were then presented visually with <strong>Chart.js</strong>, and the UI was styled with
                        <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> for a clear and responsive design. The diagnostic analysis
                        investigated fluctuations — such as seasonal drops in sales and feedback — while prescriptive
                        techniques were used to translate these findings into actionable recommendations for improving
                        sales, customer satisfaction, and inventory management.
